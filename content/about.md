## About me

Hi, my name is Andr√©s! I'm a 23 y.o. electronics engineer currently based in Valencia, Spain. Right now, I spend my time on the **front-end** side of things, developing GIS-related websites based on Angular 5 and ArcGIS.

I also enjoy making **Android apps**. You can check out some of my projects on my GitLab page.

Feel free to contact me :)
